In this Project I performed few basic machine learning concepts.
It is about classification algorithms using social network ads data set 
algorithms: 1) KNN 2) SVM 3) SVM kernal 4) Decision Tree classification 5) Radom Forest Classification


KNN
KNN means K-Nearest Neighbour classifier
It is basic classification Algorithm in ML and it is a supervised learning
Applications: Pattern Recognition
              data mining
              intrusion detection
              
SVM and kernel SVM
SVM means it is a Support Vector Machine
In this we will have a parameter called kernel 
There are 5 types of Kerels
              1) Linear
              2) rbf (default kernel)
              3) polynomial(poly)
              4) sigmoid
              5) precomputed
